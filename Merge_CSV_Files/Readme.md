# Merge CSV files

With the help of the following simple python script, we can be able to merge CSV files present in the directory. 

## Dependencies

Requires Python 3 and `pandas`

Install requirements: `pip install -r "requirements.txt"`<br/>
or<br/>
Install pandas: `pip install pandas`

## How to use

### Running
Put all the CSVs which are to be merged in a directory containing the script.<br/><br/>
Either run it from your code editor or IDE or type `python merge_csv_files.py` in your command line.

The final output would be a `combined_csv.csv` file in the same directory.
